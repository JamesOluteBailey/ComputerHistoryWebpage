    <p>Computing has had a big impact to our everyday life. Technology has been around ever since 35,000 B.C and constantly evolves till
        this day. Some people can go through the change barely realizing what has happened. Nowadays there are many devices that make
        objectives more easier and entertaining. For example, when playing video games. There are many ways to play video games than there
        were 40 years ago. Today’s cell phones has a  touchable screen, there are motion sensor that can be connected to your console, and
        virtual reality has just been recently produced. Yet, 40 years ago, this such things did not exist. In those times, there were
        only arcades, and the first few companies that made home consoles. Atari was one of the big game company during the 1970’s.
    </p>

    <p>Atari was founded in 1972 by two people named: Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They both were pioneers in arcade games, home game
        consoles, and home computers. The company split into two groups after being part of the “video game crash of 1983”. The arcade
        division of the team was changed into Atari Games Incorporated. They gained the rights of using the original logo with the added
        word of games as well as being able to use the original hardware properties from 1972 - 1984. In 1972, Atari created a game
        called “Pong”.

    <p>Pong is one of the earliest home console games. As well as being the very first arcade sport game. Pong is a table tennis game
        which featured two dimensional graphics that consested of three objects. Pong is also one of the first video games that had a
        big mainstream popularity. Allan Alcorn from Atari was the developer that created Pong in 1972 which was originally a test.
        The goal of the game was to defeat the opponent by getting the higher score of nine in a simulation of a game of table tennis.
        The game is played by the player controlling an in-game paddle vertically up and down to hit the ball back and forth with the
        opponent. The arcade began to sell in 1972. The price for one was $1095. Pong started to show up in bars, malls, bowling alleys
        and JCpenny’s. In 1975 Sears Roebuck wanted Atari to sell 150,000 units into their sporting goods department.
    </p>

    <p>Atari created another game in 1976, it was called ”Atari Breakout”. The game interested many people was was called “Pong turned
        to its side”. In 1977 Bushnell developed a system that was capable of supporting and running all four of Atari’s current games
        at the time, which were Pong, and Atari Breakout. The system was called Atari Video Computer System (VCS), but later the named
        was changed to Atari 2600 later when the new Atari 5200 was released. The price of the VCS (Atari 2600) was around $200, which
        would be over $800 today. The console consisted of two joy sticks, a single pair of paddles, and the cartridge slot. Atari
        released two modules of home computers called the “Atari 400” and “Atari 800” in 1979. Pac-Man for the 2600 was released in 1982,
        but the game was a rushed projected. This means that a project would not as good as it would have been it the developers took
        their time to complete their project. This could cause the project to have bugs, and could possibly not leave an enjoyable
        experience. The overall Pac-Man game for the 2600 was poorly made, the game did not resemble the coin-op game that can be found
        in arcade. In 1982, Atari released the “Atari 5200” which brought more control options to gaming for its time. It came with its
        flagship title called “Super Breakout”. The analog stick for the console was able to go 360 degrees on the controller which was
        unheard of for the time. There was an additional two buttons added on both the right and the left side of the controller. For the
        first time, a start/pause and reset buttons were on a controller. Even though the controller was impressive at the time, it was
        difficult to use on games that only used four directions.
    </p>

    <p>The technology for video games has changed over the four decades. There are better graphics, so it is rare to find a game made by
        a big company today that is 8-bit that many people  from the 1970’s knew about. Consoles are made differently, there are fewer
        buttons, or knobs that has to be used when starting the console. There are more companies that produces games. Overall, many
        people still enjoy playing their home consoles and Atari has had a big part in it.
